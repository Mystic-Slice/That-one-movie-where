# That one movie where...

Are you searching for a movie that you forgot the name to? But you remember its IMDB title id. Well, this website is exactly for you!

To host this website locally:
1. Clone the repository
2. `trunk serve`

If this does not work, I am sorry, you are on your own.

Btw, even if that works, the website still won't work as expected. Because I protecc my API_KEY. Try getting your own API_KEY for the [Movie Details API](https://rapidapi.com/goodmoviesaps/api/movie-details1/). If not, well, that's too bad.

### Why did I build this website?
No idea. Just wanted to try out Rust and the [Yew](https://yew.rs/) framework (React.rs?). Figured out how to use async functions too!
